In the context of computer science and information science, an ontology is a formal representation of knowledge as 
a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to reason about the 
properties of that domain and to enable knowledge sharing and reuse.

The goal of this project is to allow users to create an ontology and interact with it. There are three main concepts 
that the user of this system can interact with.

- Entities: a distinct, existent, or identifiable thing. For example, a person, vehicle, or phone.
- Events: any significant occurrence that can be identified in time and space. For example: a financial transaction, 
  GPS location from a phone, or a picture.
- Properties: A feature or quality that something possesses. This could be a physical characteristic like color 
  or shape, or an abstract quality such as value or significance.
