# Development

Before getting started, ensure the prerequisite [dependencies](./DEPENDENCIES.md) are installed.

## Codebase

One of the goals of this codebase is to use as little external dependencies as possible.

## Tests

To run the test suites:

- `make test`

To view the unit tests coverage report in a browser. The `test` recipe needs to be run first:

- `make test_unit_coverage_report`
